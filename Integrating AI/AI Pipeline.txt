When you build an AI-powered app, you usually have:

Frontend – where the user interacts (React, HTML, etc.)
Backend – your server, which calls the AI API (e.g., OpenAI’s API)

“Pipeline control” means deciding:

Where the AI request happens (client or server).
Who provides the API key (you or the user).
How much control the user has (model choice, temperature, max tokens, etc.).
